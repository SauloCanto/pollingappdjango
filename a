## 🐛 Test Output Observations

### Console Output During Test Execution

During the test suite execution, some informational and debug messages appear in the console output. These are **expected behaviors** from the test suite:

#### System Date Manipulation Messages
```
System date successfully set to 2024-02-10
System date successfully set to 2024-01-10
System date successfully set to 2019-02-20
```

- **Source:** Tests manipulating `AlternateTIMELINE` model for date-dependent logic
- **Purpose:** Tests need to simulate different time periods to validate contract dates, invoice generation, readjustments, etc.
- **Status:** ✅ Normal behavior - Part of time-travel testing pattern
- **Files:** Various test files that need to test date-sensitive business logic

#### Form Validation Error Messages (HTML)
```html
<ul class="errorlist"><li>lot_code<ul class="errorlist"><li>Le lot existe déjà</li></ul></li></ul>
```

- **Source:** Django form validation error rendering
- **Translation:** "The lot already exists" (French error message)
- **Purpose:** Tests verifying duplicate lot code validation
- **Status:** ✅ Normal behavior - Test is checking that duplicate validation works correctly
- **Files:** Likely from `test_lot_forms.py` or similar form validation tests
- **Note:** Error messages appear because tests intentionally create duplicate scenarios to verify validation
